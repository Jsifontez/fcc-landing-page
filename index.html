        Together we will build "Sick Fits", a full stack online clothing store complete with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favourite items. </p>
      <p>
        The application has five main models — Users, Items, Orders, CartItems, and OrderItems — all of which are relational and showcase the power of relational GraphQL Queries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app also includes many server side bits including JWT authentication, permissions, sending email, uploading images, and charging credit cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to building both the frontend and backend of the application, we also spend the last ⅓ of the course Testing the React application.
